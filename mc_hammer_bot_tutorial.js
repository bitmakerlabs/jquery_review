$(function() {
  // We all know the future lies with robots, so to help you jumpstart your career
  // we've written a tutorial for you to learn how to control one.
  // In Chrome you can see there are five buttons. We want you make these buttons
  // be able to move the robot around.

  // The first thing you need to know is when a button is clicked. This is done with:
  
  // $(button).on("click", function() {
  //    
  // })
  
  // You just have to put in place of button the name of the button, and after function() inside the { }
  // the code you want to run when that button is clicked.
  
  // We've given each button in the browser a name. These names are hashtags, just like in Twitter,
  // and they are: #forward, #reverse, #right, #left, and #stop.
  
  // The second thing we need to know how to do is send the robot commands. We do this using AJAX.
  // AJAX is a lot like sending an email to someone: you need an address and a message. It looks like this:
  
  // $.ajax(address, {data: message} )
  
  // The address to the robot is http://localhost:8071/motion-control/update
  // And the message you need to send depends on what you want the robot to do. 
  
  // If you want to make it go forward, the message would be: 
  // { forward: +1 }
  
  // Reverse:
  // { forward: -1 }
  
  // Right: 
  // { turn: +1 }
  
  // Left:
  // { turn: -1 }
  
  // Stop:
  // {}
  
  // That's all you need to know! Now write the code below!
